## Cosmian Github Repository

Cosmian provides API to secure the storage and processing of sensitive data in zero-trust encironments such as as he public cloud. These APIs use advanced cryptographic techniques. Since one must know what protects its sensitive data, everything Cosmian does is open sourced and available in this repository.


Here, you will find the source code for Cosmian's products and services, including examples. API Documentation is available on [docs.cosmian.com](https://docs.cosmian.com)

We encourage developers to explore, learn, and collaborate with us to build secure applications that protect their sensitive data.
