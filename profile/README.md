## Open source Github repository

Cosmian provides API to secure the storage and processing of sensitive data in zero-trust environments such as the public cloud. These APIs use advanced cryptographic techniques. Since one must know what protects its sensitive data, everything Cosmian does is open source and available in this repository.

APIs and usage documentation is available at [docs.cosmian.com](https://docs.cosmian.com)

We encourage developers to explore, learn, and collaborate with us to build secure applications that protect their sensitive data.

### Cloudproof Libraries
These librairies available in multiple languages and provide the building block to build privacy default applications with advanced encryption ( [Covercrypt](https://github.com/Cosmian/cover_crypt): post quantum, access policies, etc..) and encrypted indexes ([Findex](https://github.com/Cosmian/findex))
The user API librairies follow the naming convention `cloudproof_[LANGUAGE]`: [`cloudproof_js`](https://github.com/Cosmian/cloudproof_js), [`cloudproof_java`](https://github.com/Cosmian/cloudproof_java), [`cloudproof_python`](https://github.com/Cosmian/cloudproof_python), [`cloudproof_rust`](https://github.com/Cosmian/cloudproof_rust), ...

### Microservice Encryption
The librairies are the building blocks of the MSE platform which lets you run encrypted Python code over encrypted data. Visit the [console](https://console.cosmian.com) for details. All code related to MSE is tagged with the [`mse`](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Amse+org%3ACosmian+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories) topic.
